Todo:

1. Need to implement algorithm 3 now, the controller in response to a detected obstacle. The question is should the controller be responding to one obstacle recognition, or a wait until confirmation of obstacle?
2. For detection algorithm to be robust parallel threads computing the obstacle data are required. Check the issue for more info.
